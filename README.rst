- Ability to mark media as draft (private)

- Tweet URLs automatically once video goes live

- Style site
- Convert all "summary" values in JSON data to be rST parsible
- Implement search (google search is fine)
- Link checker (script to check that all links in site are 200 OK)
- TravisCI integration (build site on push to master or merger of PR)
- A sweet 404 page
